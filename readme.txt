Tired of going through a whole bunch of menu clicks to create a product? Create Products on a whim when searching for them.

== Description ==

Add products to order line item if the search didn't bring it up.

Speed up the Order creation process... If the product creation is tough, rough and,... nah even if the product itself doesn't exist, Create the product on a whim without going through all the hassles of creating just a simple product.

Create Products quickly without navigating through the product creation pages and traversing through the whole bunch of fields.

= When will this plugin be really a timesaver?(a stitch in time saves nine) =
Imagine if you run a startup business and you don't have enough time to add all the products to the woocommerce store catalog and even if you do, you might even miss out a few products. So Upon reaching the Orders Page, you'd wish you'd have already added the product coz if the product doesn't exist, you have to navigate to the product creation page and create the product and then come back to the orders page. Only to realize that you need to add another one. Damnnnnn. You could try to open up the new product creation page in another tab in the browser and switch to it for this purpose... but still your focus will definitely be disturbed and you'll be distracted. But with Quick Product, it is placed at the right place at the right time unlike "John Mclane" who is always at the wrong place at the wrong time.

Now to populate some meta information for the product, we might try to go back to the product edit page to edit the product that's been quickly created. To avoid this behavior, I've come up with some ideas. So you can expect something like product image fetch from wikipedia and preview those thumbs with magnifier in the same quick product strip itself. If people are really in need of this plugin, some handy features will be added soon in the next version.

= known bugs =
1) If "cancel" or "save" button is clicked on the order line metabox, the Quick Product strip will not be available until the page is refreshed or the order is updated/published.

You are free to post any bugs. That'll let me know if the concept needs to be refined a bit...

While creating/editing a woocommerce order in admin dash, the add line items popup will have this Quick Product creation strip nearby to aid you when the time comes.

Yeah you can do that if you have all the time in the world. But Imagine if you run a startup business and you don't have enough time to add all the products to the woocommerce store catalog and you might even miss out a few products. So Upon reaching the Orders Page, you'd wish you'd have already added the product coz if the product doesn't exist, you have to navigate to the product creation page and create the product and then come back to the orders page.
